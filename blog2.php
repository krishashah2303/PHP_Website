			<h2>
			<p>Books, books are the most beautiful thing created by a man. Though their size is small, but the amount of knowledge they kept in them is just invaluable. Books not only provide us with knowledge, they educate us, entertain us, and they also serve us as a good companion when we feel alone. Irrespective of their nature whether they are story books, school or college textbooks, fiction books, or any other reading book, books give more meaning to our life.</p>
            </h2>
			<h2>
			<p>In one word if I would say, "books are the man's best and loyal friend that always remain by our side without demanding anything for the service they do to mankind."</p>
			<h2>
			<p>Books do a lot to mankind, but do we repay them in kind the same way they serve? Probably, NO, we don't. After reading books when they change from new books to old used books, generally, people either keep the old books on the bookshelves or in a cupboard and forget them. Or some of them sell used books to a scrap dealer for a few pennies. This is the act of commiserate, I mean, how one can throw something invaluable in cupboards that always stood with them. Books are meant for the dissemination of ideas, fruits of knowledge. They are never meant to keep inside boxes. Do they?</p>
            </h2>
			<h2>
			<p>Now the question is what should a person do after reading new books?</p>
            </h2>
            <h2>
			<p>The answer is, resell used books to some another book lover just like you. By selling used books, you are trying to keep the book's motto alive and are helping to spread books knowledge ahead. If you like to do so, then you will definitely feel that how will I find the buyer for my book who will be ready to buy second hand books from you and where I can sell used books?
